# Getting Started into Syndicate web app project:
Use the last version (v1.0.6) branch by preference.  
In case of big difference between versions and project architecture the solution of 
publishing as different versions was made.  
## Technical stack:
- ReactJS.
- TypeScript.
- SCSS Modules.
- Class naming using BEM.
- EmailJS as front-end message delivery system.
- ReduxJS using Slices technology.
- Material UI (realized services tree).
- Axios.
- react-icons.
- react-yandex-maps.
- react-transition-group.
- swiper.
- React-three/fiber + React-three/drei for 3D models.
